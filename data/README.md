# TemStaPro data

This directory contains data related to TemStaPro development.

`SupplementaryFileC2EPsPredictions.tsv` file contains global 
thermostability predictions made by TemStaPro using mean embeddings 
for Class II effector proteins(C2EP), which is a collection of 
proteins from Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, and TnpB groups.

`SupplementaryC2EPClashAnalysis.xlsx` file contains analysis of
C2EP prediction conflicts.

`SupplementaryTableCharacterizedC2EPs.xlsx` file contains the 
full table experimentally characterized and predicted temperatures 
of C2EP proteins.

`SupplementaryMeltingTemperatureSourceData.xlsx` file contains 
raw traces of nanoDSF assays.

Datasets that were used to train, validate, and test TemStaPro are 
available in  [Zenodo.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7743638)
